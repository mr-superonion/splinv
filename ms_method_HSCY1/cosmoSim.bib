  abstract={We investigate weak lensing by large-scale structure using ray tracing through N -body simulations. Photon trajectories are followed through high-resolution simulations of structure formation to make simulated maps of shear and convergence on the sky. Tests with varying numerical parameters are used to calibrate the accuracy of computed lensing statistics on angular scales from ~1' to a few degrees. Various aspects of the weak-lensing approximation are also tested. We show that the nonscalar component of the shear generated by the multiple deflections is small. For fields a few degrees on a side, the shear power spectrum is almost entirely in the nonlinear regime and agrees well with nonlinear analytical predictions. Sampling fluctuations in power-spectrum estimates are investigated by comparing several ray-tracing realizations of a given model. For survey areas smaller than 1° on a side, the main source of scatter is nonlinear coupling to modes larger than the survey. We develop a method that uses this effect to estimate Ω m from the scatter in power-spectrum estimates for subregions of a larger survey. We show that the power spectrum can be measured accurately on scales corresponding to 1-10 h -1 Mpc with realistic number densities of source galaxies with large intrinsic ellipticities. Non-Gaussian features in the one-point distribution function of the weak-lensing convergence (reconstructed from the shear) are also sensitive to Ω m . We suggest several techniques for estimating Ω m in the presence of noise and compare their statistical power, robustness, and simplicity. With realistic number densities of source galaxies, Ω m can be determined to within 0.1-0.2 from a deep survey of several square degrees.}

	abstract = {We present 108 full-sky gravitational lensing simulation data sets generated by performing multiple-lens plane ray-tracing through high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations. The data sets include full-sky convergence and shear maps from redshifts z = 0.05 to 5.3 at intervals of  comoving radial distance (corresponding to a redshift interval of  at the nearby universe), enabling the construction of a mock shear catalog for an arbitrary source distribution up to z = 5.3. The dark matter halos are identified from the same N-body simulations with enough mass resolution to resolve the host halos of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) CMASS and luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Angular positions and redshifts of the halos are provided by a ray-tracing calculation, enabling the creation of a mock halo catalog to be used for galaxy–galaxy and cluster–galaxy lensing. The simulation also yields maps of gravitational lensing deflections for a source redshift at the last scattering surface, and we provide 108 realizations of lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps in which the post-Born corrections caused by multiple light scattering are included. We present basic statistics of the simulation data, including the angular power spectra of cosmic shear, CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, galaxy–galaxy lensing signals for halos, and their covariances. The angular power spectra of the cosmic shear and CMB anisotropies agree with theoretical predictions within 5% up to  (or at an angular scale  arcmin). The simulation data sets are generated primarily for the ongoing Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, but are freely available for download at http://cosmo.phys.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/takahasi/allsky_raytracing/.}
